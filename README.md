# PyBer Analysis


# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis is to make weekly fare comparison on three different types of cities: urban, suburban and rural. The analysis will provide visualization which areas provide highest revenue, how much is the average fare per ride and how much is the average fare per driver. These information will help the CEO of the ridesharing company where they can improve their service to help the passenger cost, per driver's earnings and overall increase in profitability.


# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison on different types of cities total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The summary helps which areas have higher demands for rides and how much average fare per ride can be earn per driver. The importance to consider when decision makers are looking at the summary is do they need to add or reduce more drivers in diffrent types of cities. Overall, the goal for PyBer is to stay profitable and keep their drivers (independent contractors) happy by means of higher earnings per ride. Based on the summary below, although urban areas have the highest rides, total drivers total fares but it has the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The results is vice versa on ruaral area.

The chart below shows the percentage total rides by city type. This chart shows the that 68.4% of the total rides in the same period is in the urban area, 26.3% in suburban and 5.3% in rural areas. These total number of rides tells us that urban has the highest demand during the same time period.

The chart below shows the percentage total of drivers by city type. Again, in the city type like urban, there's a high demand of rides due to density of population as we can assume therefore there are higher number of drivers. In urban area, 80.9% of the total drivers takes majority of the chart, 16.5% in suburban and 2.6% in rural areas respectively. It is evident the correlatations in percentages of rides (high demand). The higher the demand, the higher the total number of drivers.

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
the challenge is the lack of data on cost per mile and time in three different city types. Rural area fares per ride may be higher compare to the urban and suburban areas, this maybe the distance between the destinations per ride.
